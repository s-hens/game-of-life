# Conway's Game of Life

### [Live demo](https://s-hens.github.io/game-of-life/)

## Summary

Here is John Horton Conway's classic cellular automaton, built in vanilla JavaScript.

Working on this project, I challenged myself to:
- Create a visually engaging layout using just CSS, no image files
	- The only image file in this project is the favicon
	- This resulted in much longer HTML and CSS files than were strictly necessary, but it was a fun exercise
- Create a mobile-friendly version of the project using media queries and responsive design

## I learned about...

- Cellular automatons
- Media queries for mobile-friendly design
- Testing cross-browser compatibility
